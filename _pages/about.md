### Hello and Welcome! 
I am a sixth year PhD student at the University of Chicago, studying under [Alex Eskin](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/). My graduate studies are supported by a [GFSP award](https://stemfellowships.org). I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelors of science in 2018. I can be reached by email [here](mailto:relliottsmith@uchicago.edu).

### Research Interests: 
Generically[^1], I study measure classification and rigidity in partially hyperbolic systems, approaching the smooth dynamical setting with the tools of homogeneous dynamics. See [publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) for recent work.


### Recent Talks: 
- October 2023, Dynamics Seminar (Universidad de la Rep√∫blica)
- September 2023, WOMP 2023 (University of Chicago)
- April 2023, Beyond Uniform Hyperbolicity (Poland)
- February 2023, Dynamics Seminar (University of Chicago)



### Upcoming Travel:
I plan to attend the following conferences and workshops:
- Group Actions with Hyperbolicity and Measure Rigidity (IHP)
- Women in Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory (Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi)
