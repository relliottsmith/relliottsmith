### Hello and Welcome! 
I am a NSF postdoctoral fellow and G.C. Evans Instructor at Rice University, mentored by [David Fisher](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/david-fisher). In 2024, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Alex Eskin](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/), supported by a [GFSP award](https://stemfellowships.org). I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelors of science in 2018. I can be reached by email [here](mailto:re30@rice.edu).

### Research Interests: 
Generically[^1], I study measure classification and rigidity in partially hyperbolic systems, approaching the smooth dynamical setting with the tools of homogeneous dynamics. See [publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) for recent work.


### Recent Talks: 
- September 2024, Geometry Seminar (Rice University)
- May 2024, Group Actions with Hyperbolicity and Measure Rigidity (IHP)
- May 2024, Women in Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory (Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi)






### Upcoming Travel:
I plan to attend the following conferences and workshops:
- Alex Eskin's 60th Birthday Conference (June 2025)
- TBD
