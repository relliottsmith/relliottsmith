### hello and welcome! 
I am a fifth year PhD student at the University of Chicago, studying under [Alex Eskin](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/) and [Amie Wilkinson](https://math.uchicago.edu/~wilkinso/). My graduate studies are supported by a [GFSP award](https://stemfellowships.org). I can be reached by email [here](mailto:relliottsmith@uchicago.edu).

### research interests: 
Generically[^1], I study the behavior of random walks in the smooth dynamical setting. More specifically, my research focuses on detecting-- and building the tools to detect-- different types of expansion in a given dynamical system, with the hope of building a criterion to detect zero Lyapunov exponents. I hope to hone this perspective, with the long term goal of turning these tools towards discovering new measure classification theorems. See [publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) for recent work. 
### service, outreach, and other:

- September 2022, WOMP 2022 (University of Chicago): "The Mathematicianâ€™s Terrible, No-Good, Very Bad Example"
- July 2022, Graduate Student Summer Seminar (University of Chicago): "A sketch of the proof of Ratner's Theorem"


### upcoming travel:
I plan to attend the following conferences and workshops:
