### Hello and welcome! 
I am a fifth year PhD student at the University of Chicago, studying under [Alex Eskin](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/) and [Amie Wilkinson](https://math.uchicago.edu/~wilkinso/). My graduate studies are supported by a [GFSP award](https://stemfellowships.org).

### Research interests: 
Generically[^1], I study the behavior of random walks in the smooth dynamical setting. More specifically, my research focuses on detecting-- and building the tools to detect-- different types of expansion in a given dynamical system, with the hope of building a criterion to detect zero Lyapunov exponents. I hope to hone this perspective, with the long term goal of turning these tools to discovering new measure classification theorems.
