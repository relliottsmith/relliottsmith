### Hello and Welcome! 
I am a fifth year PhD student at the University of Chicago, studying under [Alex Eskin](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/) and [Amie Wilkinson](https://math.uchicago.edu/~wilkinso/). My graduate studies are supported by a [GFSP award](https://stemfellowships.org). I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelors of science in 2018. I can be reached by email [here](mailto:relliottsmith@uchicago.edu).

### Research Interests: 
Generically[^1], I study the behavior of random walks in the smooth dynamical setting. More specifically, my research focuses on detecting-- and building the tools to detect-- different types of expansion in a given dynamical system, with the hope of building a criterion to detect zero Lyapunov exponents. I hope to hone this perspective, with the long term goal of turning these tools towards discovering new measure classification theorems. See [publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) for recent work.


### Recent Talks: 
- October 2022, Pizza Seminar (University of Chicago): "Gerrymandering: What if Geometry had Politics?"
- September 2022, WOMP 2022 (University of Chicago): "The Mathematicianâ€™s Terrible, No-Good, Very Bad Example"
- July 2022, Graduate Student Summer Seminar (University of Chicago): "A sketch of the proof of Ratner's Theorem"

### Service, Outreach, and Other:
- 


### Upcoming Travel:
I plan to attend the following conferences and workshops:
- JMM 2022, Boston
- 2023 Program for Women and Mathematics
