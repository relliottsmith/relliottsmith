### general
> - **Ombudsperson 2019-2021**: I was elected and served as graduate student ombudsperson for the mathematics department at UChicago from May 2019 - September 2021. In this role I acted as a liaison between graduate students and faculty, handling issues ranging from truly minor to serious. I worked closely with the faculty throughout my tenure, and was responsible for organizing quarterly townhalls with the graduate students at large. 


### organizational
> - **Seminar Organizer 2022-**: I co-organized a dynamics student seminar in the summer of 2022, and worked with dynamics faculty at UChicago to transition it to a proseminar attached to the general [dynamics seminar](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dynamics/). It now functions as an introductory talk for the general talk, providing essential background for more specialized subjects. 
> - **Graduate Orientation Organizer 2022**: I co-organized the graduate student orientation in 2022 ([WOMP 2022](http://math.uchicago.edu/~womp/2022/)), a week long math-heavy event intended to introduce new students to the department.
