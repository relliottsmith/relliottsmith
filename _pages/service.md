### General
- Ombudsperson: I was elected and served as graduate student ombudsperson for the mathematics department at UChicago from May 2019 - September 2021. In this role I acted as a liaison between graduate students and faculty, handling issues ranging from truly minor to serious. I worked closely with the faculty throughout my tenure, and was responsible for organizing quarterly townhalls with the graduate students at large. 


### Organizational
- Seminar Organizer: I co-organized a dynamics student seminar in the summer of 2022. 
- Graduate Orientation Organizer: I co-organized the graduate student orientation in 2022 (WOMP 2022), a week long math-heavy event intended to introduce new students to the department.
